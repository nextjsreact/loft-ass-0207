## Current Focus: Transaction, Task, and Loft Filtering

The primary focus of the current work has been to implement filtering functionality on the lofts, tasks, and transactions list pages. This involved several changes across the application to support filtering by status, owner, zone area, date range, transaction type, category, and currency.

## Recent Changes

*   **Database Error Handling**: Fixed a critical bug in `app/actions/auth.ts` where the application would crash if the `users` table did not exist. The error handling has been updated to use a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle this scenario and create the table if it is missing.
*   **Type Definitions**: Updated `lib/types.ts` to include a new `ZoneArea` interface and added `zone_area_id` and `zone_area_name` to the `Loft` interface. This was necessary to support filtering by zone area. I also updated the `Loft` type to allow `zone_area_id` to be `null`.
*   **Data Fetching**: Modified `app/lofts/page.tsx`, `app/tasks/page.tsx`, and `app/transactions/page.tsx` to fetch all the necessary data for filtering.
*   **Loft Filtering UI**: Implemented filter dropdowns for status, owner, and zone area in `app/lofts/lofts-list.tsx`.
*   **Date Picker Component**: Created a new reusable `DatePicker` component in `components/ui/date-picker.tsx`.
*   **Task Filtering UI**: Created a new `TasksList` component in `app/tasks/tasks-list.tsx` to handle client-side filtering of tasks by status and date range.
*   **Transaction Filtering UI**: Created a new `TransactionsList` component in `app/transactions/transactions-list.tsx` to handle client-side filtering of transactions by date range, type, category, loft, and currency.
*   **Transaction Summary**: Added a summary section to the `TransactionsList` component to display total income, total expenses, and the net total.
*   **Tasks Page**: Updated `app/tasks/page.tsx` to use the new `TasksList` component.
*   **Transactions Page**: Updated `app/transactions/page.tsx` to use the new `TransactionsList` component.

## Next Steps

*   **Testing**: Verify that the new filtering functionality on the Lofts, Tasks, and Transactions pages works as expected.
*   **Code Review**: Review the recent changes for any potential issues or improvements.
*   **Deployment**: Deploy the new functionality to the production environment.
