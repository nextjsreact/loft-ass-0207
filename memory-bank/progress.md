# Project Progress

This document tracks the development progress, key decisions, and next steps for the Loft Management System.

## Current Status (as of 2025-06-26)

*   **Completed**: Fixed a critical bug in the database initialization logic (`app/actions/auth.ts`). The original code was causing a `TypeError` due to incorrect error handling. The fix ensures that the `users`, `loft_owners`, and `lofts` tables are created reliably if they don't exist.
*   **Verified**: The fix was verified by creating and running a temporary test script (`test-db-tables.cjs`) that successfully connected to the database and confirmed the existence of the `users` table.
*   **In Progress**: Cleaning up the development environment by removing temporary test files and addressing the root cause of module conflicts.

## Key Decisions & Learnings

*   The project's ES Module configuration (`"type": "module"`) creates a strict environment where mixing `import` and `require` statements, or having both `.ts` and `.js` versions of the same file, leads to runtime errors.
*   Directly running TypeScript files with `ts-node` or compiling them with `tsc` created conflicting `.js` files that broke the Next.js development server.
*   The most reliable way to test database functionality was to create a dedicated test script that respects the project's module system, or to create a temporary API endpoint.

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete Cleanup**: Finish removing all temporary test files (`.ts`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`) and the temporary API route (`app/api/test-db`).
2.  **Remove Compiled JS Files**: Systematically find and delete all compiled `.js` files that are creating conflicts with the `.ts` source files.
3.  **Prevent Future Conflicts**: Modify the `tsconfig.json` to prevent the TypeScript compiler from outputting `.js` files in the project directory (using `"noEmit": true`).
4.  **Final Verification**: Restart the `next dev` server to ensure all "Duplicate page detected" warnings are resolved and the application runs cleanly.
